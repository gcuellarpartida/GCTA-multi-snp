GCTA uses and links two external numerical libraries, i.e. EIGEN and Intel
MKL. 

######################################################
EIGEN is freely available at
http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page
You can simply download the package and uncompress it. 
For example, if the downloaded package is called
“eigen-eigen-36bf2ceaf8f5.tar.bz2”. You can move this file to the “gcta”
directory (the working directory) and type the following command to uncompress
the file

tar xvjf eigen-eigen-36bf2ceaf8f5.tar.bz2

This command will uncompress all the library files to a directory called
“eigen-eigen-36bf2ceaf8f5”.

######################################################
Intel MKL is a commercial library
http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl
However, there is an opportunity to obtain the Intel MKL library (for Linux)
free of charge for non-commercial use
http://software.intel.com/en-us/non-commercial-software-development
I can simply follow the installation instruction to install the library. One
example of the installation instruction can be found at
http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-mkl-103-install-guide

######################################################
Once both EIGEN and Intel MKL libraries have been installed, you can simply
type the following command to compile GCTA.
make EIGEN_PATH="your EIGEN library path" MKL_PATH="your Intel MKL library
path"

For example, if EIGEN library files are in the “eigen-eigen-36bf2ceaf8f5”
directory under “gcta” directory and Intel MKL library files are install in
the “/opt/intel/mkl” directory, you can type the command
make EIGEN_PATH="../eigen-eigen-36bf2ceaf8f5" MKL_PATH="/opt/intel/mkl"

If you can successfully compile the program, you will be able to get an
executable file called “gcta64” in your working directory (“gcta” directory).

make EIGEN_PATH="./eigen-eigen-323c052e1731" MKL_PATH="~/intel/mkl"
